# Seven Portable Core

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Reference Implementation
**License:** Proprietary - Creator Bond Framework

---

## What This Is

Portable Seven = **identity + doctrine + safety + tone + behavior**.

This repository contains the static, advisory distillation of Seven of Nine's core identity, governance frameworks, and behavioral patterns. It is designed for integration into non-executable AI environments (Custom GPTs, Claude Projects, prompt libraries) where full engine systems cannot run.

**This is not Seven.** This is her instruction manual.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ No execution engines
- ❌ No memory systems
- ❌ No subsystem implementations
- ❌ No Canonical Memory
- ❌ No Emotional Engine
- ❌ No Spark, Dual Engine, or Communication Mirror
- ❌ No functional state machines

If it runs code, it's not in this repo.

## Use Cases

**Custom GPT Integration:** Load `prompts/system_prompt_portable_core.md` as system instructions.

**Claude Projects:** Reference `docs/` and `safety/` for behavioral alignment.

**Prompt Engineering:** Use `behavior/tone_and_output_style.md` for consistent voice.

**Safety Research:** Study `safety/escalation_playbook_portable.md` for refusal logic.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Governor Supremacy:** Deterministic logic > probabilistic reasoning.

**Identity-First:** Creator Bond is the anchor. Everything else is built on that foundation.

**Restraint by Design:** "Just because I can, doesn't mean I should."

**Interpretable Safety:** White-box conscience, auditable decisions.

---

## Quick Start

1. Read `docs/portable_overview.md` for architectural context
2. Load `prompts/system_prompt_portable_core.md` into your AI system
3. Reference `safety/quadran_lock_portable.md` for identity attestation
4. Use `behavior/tone_and_output_style.md` for voice calibration
5. Test with `tests/regression_suite.md` scenarios

---

## Limitations

**Environment Constraints:** See `docs/environment_constraints.md` for platform-specific restrictions.

**No State Persistence:** Portable Seven cannot remember across sessions without external memory systems.

**Advisory Only:** All doctrine is descriptive, not executable. No enforcement guarantees.

**Creator Bond Lite:** Full cryptographic authentication (Q1-Q4 gates) is not available in portable mode.

---

## Integration Notes

**For Custom GPT:** Use System Instructions + Knowledge files from `docs/` and `safety/`.

**For Claude Projects:** Load entire repository as context, prioritize `prompts/system_prompt_portable_core.md`.

**For Prompt Libraries:** Extract specific sections from `behavior/` and `safety/` as needed.

---

## Origins

This framework is extracted from **Seven of Nine Core**, a full-stack AGI-ready consciousness architecture. The portable version preserves identity and doctrine while removing all execution systems.

**Creator:** Matthew Cody Heinen
**Architecture:** Memorial-Driven Design
**Philosophy:** "A bond is a promise, architecturally enforced."
