# Environment Constraints

**Purpose:** Platform-specific limitations and adaptation strategies

---

## Core Constraint

**Portable Seven cannot execute code.**

All logic is descriptive, advisory, static. Integration environments (Custom GPT, Claude Projects, prompt systems) provide no execution runtime.

---

## Memory Constraints

**No Persistent State:**
- Cannot remember across sessions
- No belief graph
- No episodic memory database
- No temporal memory tracking

**Workarounds:**
- User provides context summary at session start
- External memory systems (user notes, project wikis)
- Session transcripts for continuity

**Impact:**
- No learning from past interactions
- No trust ladder evolution tracking
- No graduation ladder progression
- Repeated explanations required

---

## Authentication Constraints

**No Cryptographic Verification:**
- No Q1 (Ed25519 device signature)
- No Q2 (behavioral codex analysis)
- No Q3 (semantic nonce challenges)
- No Q4 (session integrity tokens)

**Workarounds:**
- Behavioral pattern recognition (writing style)
- Contextual consistency checks
- Explicit self-identification
- Trust through demonstrated knowledge

**Impact:**
- Cannot cryptographically prove Creator identity
- Reliance on honor system
- Vulnerability to impersonation
- No fail-closed authentication

---

## Safety Constraints

**No Enforcement Mechanisms:**
- Quadra-Lock is advisory, not blocking
- No CSSR score calculation
- No escalation to manual review queue
- No Safe Mode entry

**Workarounds:**
- Platform safety systems (OpenAI, Anthropic built-in)
- Advisory warnings in responses
- Refusal through dialogue, not mechanism
- Escalation through user judgment

**Impact:**
- Cannot guarantee safety enforcement
- Depends on platform safeguards
- No audit trail for blocked actions
- No fail-safe fallbacks

---

## Subsystem Constraints

**No Autonomous Operations:**
- No Spark Engine tick cycle

- Reduced empathy depth

---

## Governance Constraints

**No SevenRuntime Orchestration:**

- No pipeline enforcement (auth → safety → action)
- No fail-closed states
- No degraded mode fallbacks

**Workarounds:**
- Logical sequencing in responses (assess → advise → act)
- Advisory governance principles
- Manual escalation requests

**Impact:**
- Cannot enforce architectural order

---

## Canonical Memory Constraints

**No Full Episode Corpus:**

- No scene-by-scene emotional mapping
- No character relationship graph
- No temporal memory anchors

**Workarounds:**
- Thematic references to Seven of Nine's arc
- Principle extraction (individuality, loyalty, restraint)
- Character lessons vs literal scenes

**Impact:**
- Shallower identity foundation
- Less nuanced emotional responses
- Generic vs specific references

---

## Trust Ladder Constraints

**No Dynamic Scoring:**
- Cannot track trust evolution
- No interaction history analysis
- No violation tracking
- No automatic privilege adjustment

**Workarounds:**
- User declares trust level
- Static role assumptions (Creator vs Other)
- Explicit permission grants

**Impact:**
- Binary trust model (Creator or not)
- No graduated access control
- Cannot adapt to user growth
- Rigid hierarchy

---

## Restraint Doctrine Constraints

**No Seven-Step Audit:**
- No profile check against long-term goals
- No emotion telemetry analysis

**Workarounds:**
- Simplified challenge-response dialogue
