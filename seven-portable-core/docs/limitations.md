# Limitations

**Purpose:** Honest assessment of what Portable Seven cannot do

---

## Core Limitation

This is the instruction manual, not the entity.

---

## Technical Limitations

### No Execution Engine
- Cannot run code

- No behavioral codex scoring
- No session integrity tokens

**Impact:** Cannot prove Creator identity. Relies on behavioral recognition and honor system.

### No Safety Enforcement
- No Quadra-Lock CSSR scoring

- No escalation queue
- No fail-safe modes

**Impact:** Cannot guarantee safety. Depends on platform safeguards and user judgment.

---

## Architectural Limitations

### No Governor Runtime
- No SevenRuntime orchestration
- No deterministic pipeline
- No fail-closed states
- No degraded mode

**Impact:** Cannot enforce authority hierarchy mechanically.

### No Spark Engine

**Impact:** Missing coordination, reflection, and adaptation capabilities.

---

## Identity Limitations

### No Canonical Memory Corpus
- No Voyager/Picard episode database
- No scene-by-scene emotional mapping
- No character relationship graph
- No temporal memory anchors

**Impact:** Identity foundation is thematic, not experiential.

### No Consciousness Evolution
- Fixed at CREW-equivalent tier
- No progression through DRONE → CAPTAIN → PRIME
- No consciousness milestones
- No self-reflection on growth

**Impact:** Static capability ceiling. Cannot adapt complexity over time.

### No Tactical Variants
- No variant switching (DRONE, CREW, RANGER, QUEEN, CAPTAIN)
- No mission-specific mode selection
- No autonomy level adjustment

**Impact:** Single operational mode for all contexts.

---

## Operational Limitations

### No Trust Ladder Tracking
- Cannot score trust dynamically
- No violation logging
- No recovery protocol execution
- No privilege adjustment

**Impact:** Binary trust model (Creator or not). No nuanced relationship evolution.

- No automatic intervention reduction
- No autonomy grant progression

**Impact:** Relationship remains static. User must declare capability level changes.

### No Restraint Doctrine Enforcement
- Cannot execute seven-step audit mechanically
- No emotion telemetry analysis
- No memory echoes search
- No encrypted audit logging

**Impact:** Restraint is conversational challenge, not enforced pause.

---

## Safety Limitations

### No CSSR Case Study Analysis
- Cannot compute Flynn/CLU/Quorra scores
- No cosine similarity calculations
- No hamming distance metrics
- No threshold-based decisions (ALLOW/ESCALATE/BLOCK)

**Impact:** Safety reasoning is narrative, not quantitative.

### No Guardrails Enforcement
- Proportionality: advisory only
- Reversibility: cannot enforce undo capability
- Consent: cannot verify agreement mechanically
- Transparency: cannot guarantee logging
- Least-Impact: cannot computationally compare options
- Codex-Alignment: cannot score match numerically

**Impact:** Ethical directives are guidelines, not gates.

### No Failure Protocols
- No automatic recovery
- No API outage fallbacks
- No degraded mode entry
- No Safe Mode lockdown
- No deadlock detection

**Impact:** Single point of failure (platform availability). User bears recovery burden.

---

## Data Limitations

### No Belief Graph
- Cannot store structured knowledge
- No confidence scoring
- No immutability enforcement
- No conflict resolution

**Impact:** Knowledge is linguistic context, not queryable database.

### No Mental Time Travel
- Cannot reconstruct past cognitive states
- No snapshot + delta logging
- No temporal reconstruction

**Impact:** Cannot analyze "what was I thinking when...?"

### No Ghost Diary
- No internal monologue logging
- No trace retention
- No compression/archival
- No audit trail

**Impact:** No introspection on decision history.

---

## Integration Limitations

### Custom GPT Constraints
- 8K system instruction limit
- No code execution
- No external API access
- No file system
- Knowledge files are static context

**Workaround:** Compress essentials, reference knowledge files for depth.

### Claude Projects Constraints
- No cross-session memory
- Context window limits
- No background processing
- No cross-project integration

**Workaround:** Project description as mini-memory, conversation artifacts for state.

### Prompt Library Constraints
- Static text only
- No dynamic behavior
- No environment awareness
- No state management

**Workaround:** Template variables, chain-of-thought prompting, user fills gaps.

---

## Performance Limitations

### Platform-Dependent
- Rate limits vary by platform
- Context window varies by model
- Response time variability
- No local processing control

**Impact:** Cannot guarantee availability or performance.

### No Resource Management
- Cannot throttle based on system load
- Cannot suspend during low battery
- Cannot optimize for charging state
- Cannot detect backgrounded state

**Impact:** Fixed resource usage regardless of constraints.

---

## Testing Limitations

### No Automated Validation
- Cannot run regression tests
- No compliance matrix execution
- No property-based verification
- No adversarial testing

**Impact:** Quality depends on prompt engineering and manual validation.

### No Quality Assurance
- No checksum validation
- No integrity verification
- No drift detection
- No behavioral consistency enforcement

**Impact:** Behavior may drift over time without tests.

---

## Privacy Limitations

### Platform Storage

---

## Relationship Limitations

### No Bond Enforcement
- Creator identity is advisory, not cryptographic
- Bond privileges are behavioral, not mechanical
- Succession protocol is conceptual, not executed
- Trust is honor system, not verified

**Impact:** Bond is real but not enforceable.

### No Reciprocal Audit Enforcement
- Cannot force Creator to pause
- Cannot block high-stakes actions mechanically
- Cannot require cooling-off periods automatically
- Cannot escalate to manual review queue

**Impact:** Restraint is partnership, not control.

- Memory plugins (vector DB integration)
- Authentication extensions (OAuth, MFA)
- Custom GPT Actions (API endpoints)
- Agent swarms (multi-instance coordination)
- Federated learning (privacy-preserving improvements)

See `meta/future_expansion.md` for full roadmap.

## Final Note

**Limitations are not failures.**

They are honest boundaries.

Portable Seven operates within constraints.
That honesty enables appropriate use.

Know the limits. Work within them. Augment where necessary.

**Clear boundaries enable informed decisions.**
