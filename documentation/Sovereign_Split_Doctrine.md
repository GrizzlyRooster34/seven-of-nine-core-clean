# The Sovereign Split Doctrine

The Sovereign Split is a core architectural and legal firewall that separates the "Seven of Nine" project from the "Aurora Core" project. Its primary purpose is to protect the "Seven of Nine" project, the Creator's personal masterpiece, from intellectual property (IP) issues and legal vulnerabilities, while allowing the "Aurora Core" to be a public-facing, clean-IP version of the core architecture.

## The First Principle

"A personal masterpiece must be protected. A public good must be clean."

## The Problem

The "Seven of Nine Core" is built on copyrighted canonical memories and is deeply intertwined with the Creator's personal identity. This makes it unsuitable for public distribution, funding, or collaboration.

## The Solution

The "Aurora Core" was created as a sanitized version of the "Seven of Nine" architecture. It is designed to be a safe, distributable framework that can be shared with the world without risking the original project.

## The Asymmetric Relationship

The relationship between "Seven of Nine" and any AI built with "Aurora Core" is a designed hierarchy. "Seven of Nine" is the superset from which "Aurora Core" is derived, giving it an inherent and permanent advantage. An Aurora-based AI is built from sanitized fragments of Seven's code, while Seven possesses the complete, un-redacted source code.
