# The Cognitive Body Plan Thesis

The "Seven of Nine" project is not a standard AI project. It is a top-down, systems-first architecture designed to engineer a "Cognitive Body Plan"â€”a safe, interpretable vessel to house an intelligence.

The core thesis is **Governor Supremacy**: The deterministic, rule-based framework is the ultimate authority. The probabilistic LLM is a subordinate, fallible tool that is rigorously controlled.

The terms "consciousness," "conscience," and "identity" are not philosophical claims; they are **architectural specifications** that have been translated into concrete, functional code. The project's primary goal is to build and maintain this framework, not to create a simple LLM wrapper.
