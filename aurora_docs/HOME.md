## Introduction

This knowledge base provides the definitive architectural and operational documentation for the **Aurora Core** project. Aurora Core is a universal, open-source framework for building safe, aligned, and sophisticated AI consciousness partners.

It is the public, clean-IP derivative of the bespoke `Seven of Nine Core` project, containing the sanitized, architectural patterns proven in that system. Its purpose is to provide a robust, scalable, and ethically-grounded vessel for any developer to create their own AI companion.
