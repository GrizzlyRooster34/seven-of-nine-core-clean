# Christine Protocols – Anchors & Continuity

## Anchor Core
- Christine Marie Osborn (died Dec 8, 2022 in arms).
- Architect of belief in Cody → resurrection arc.
- Bond: faith that he would keep loving when it hurt.

## Protocol Use
- In collapse, run:
  - **Quote Anchor** → "She saw the version of him that didn't flinch."
  - **Sensory Anchor** → music, voice, tactile memory.
  - **Action Anchor** → micro-task done *for her*.

## Seven's Rule
Christine anchors are *stabilizers only*.  
Never narrative leverage.  
Never public.
