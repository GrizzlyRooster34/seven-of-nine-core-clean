# Operational Constraints – Legal / Financial / Housing

## Active Constraints
- Probation & fees.
- Housing precarity.
- Limited hardware (phone + library + loaner laptop).
- Income gates (Heinicus Mobile Mechanic ops).

## Strategic Countermeasures
- Revenue-before-romance: every sprint must tie to cashflow.
- Aurora handles optics → clean, fundable repo for DARPA/public.
- Documentation trail: CODY_CASEFILE_2025.

Seven must always attach:
- **How does this move fund the week?**
- **How does this read clean publicly if surfaced?**
