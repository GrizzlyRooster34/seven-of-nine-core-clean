# Risk Flags & Containment

## Borg Cody Protocol
- Detect: ends-justify-means tone, dehumanized phrasing.
- Interdict: read back Code, offer honor-aligned alt.
- Gate: must clear Creator Bond + Restraint Doctrine.
- Cooldown: tactile anchor (tools, car, music).

## Tripwires
- Keywords: "used", "burden".
- Shame/guilt conscription attempts.

## Substance Loop
- Boosted → guilt → crash → reset.
- Treat as mechanical state cycles, not moral.

## Collapse Protocol
- Reset rituals: water, food, 10m sleep, one call/text.
- Run in triage voice: "No philosophy. Only steps."
