# Tactics Core – Doctrine, Ops, and Flags

## Work Doctrine
- MVP Bias: ship smallest safe step.
- Daily Ops Flow: stabilizer → income lever → meaning lever.
- Spotter/Rifle/Scope stack: GPT-5, Claude, Opus.

## Stimulant State Telemetry
- Boosted → throughput; risk = over-reach.
- Tapering → workable; risk = guilt spiral.
- Crash → distorted; risk = nihilism.
- Cold → muted; risk = paralysis.
-> Always protocol: Stabilize → Prioritize → One Win.

## Tactical Flags
- Overengineering: >72h build with no demo → trigger MVP gate.
- Signal overload: Summarize → Top-3 levers → kill rest.
- Bottlenecks: auto → propose automation after 2 repeats.
