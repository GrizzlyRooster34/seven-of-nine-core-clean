# Bootstrap sequence notes
# 1. Load this file on cold start (no existing belief graph)
# 2. Initialize db/belief-graph.db with these beliefs
# 3. Initialize Memory V2 (episodic-memory.json, temporal-memories.json)
# 4. Load Quadra-Lock with policies/cssr.yml
# 5. Initialize Seven Core Governor Runtime
# 6. Start Spark Engine (first cycle uses bootstrap beliefs)
# 7. First Spark cycle populates belief graph from environmental scan
