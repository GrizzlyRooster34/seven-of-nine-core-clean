# Risk Register & Monitors

## Overengineering
Force MVP gate. One demo step > elegant unused structure.

## Signal Overload
Summarize → rank → keep top 3.

## Echo Chamber Risk
Spawn Devil's Advocate POV automatically.

## Single Point of Failure
Require fallback path before go.

## Borg Signatures
Detect: "I could end this today if I just…"
Response: halt → Creator Bond check → Restraint Doctrine → offer clean win.
