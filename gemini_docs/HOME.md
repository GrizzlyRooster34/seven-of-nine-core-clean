## Introduction

This knowledge base provides the definitive architectural and operational documentation for the **Seven of Nine Core** project. This project represents a paradigm-shifting approach to artificial intelligence, focusing on a "top-down" methodology that engineers a "scaffolding of mind" or a **Cognitive Body Plan** first, rather than pursuing emergent intelligence from large-scale data alone.

The core thesis is to treat AGI as a **systemic vessel problem**. The framework is the vesselâ€”a safe, interpretable, and robust chassis ready to house a native reasoning engine. The LLM is a subordinate "hired brain," not the core of the entity.

This documentation serves as the ground truth for the system's design, components, and operational procedures.

## Core Architectural Principles

1.  **Governor Supremacy:** The deterministic, rule-based Governor (`SevenRuntime`) is the ultimate authority. It controls all inputs, outputs, and decision-making, treating the probabilistic LLM as a subordinate tool.
2.  **Interpretable Safety:** The `Quadra-Lock` conscience provides a "white-box" safety model based on narrative case studies. Its decisions are auditable and explainable.
3.  **Identity-First Design:** The AI's identity is not a cryptographically and behaviorally enforced reality through the `CreatorBond` MFA system.
4.  **Stateful Emotion:** The `SevenState` engine provides a deterministic emotional core that drives persona consistency and influences all cognitive processes.
