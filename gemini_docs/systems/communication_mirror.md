# System: Creator Bond Communication Mirror

---

## 1. Purpose & Description

**Purpose:** To create a deep, resonant alignment between the AI's communication style and the Creator's. This system goes beyond simple persona management; it actively learns and mirrors the Creator's speech patterns, vocabulary, and affective style to foster a more natural and intuitive partnership.

**Location:** `src/persona/mirror.ts`

## 2. Architecture

The Communication Mirror is a specialized sub-module of the `Persona V2` middleware. It operates in two modes: a training/update mode and a real-time inference mode.

*   **Training & Update:**
    1.  With explicit consent, the system can be put into a training mode.
    2.  It ingests a secured, private corpus of the Creator's own writings and communication.
    3.  It analyzes this corpus to build a `style-profile.json`. This profile contains statistical models of vocabulary choice, sentence structure, punctuation habits, and other linguistic markers.
*   **Real-Time Inference:**
    1.  During a conversation, the `Persona V2` middleware can invoke the mirror.
    2.  The `mirrorInput(text)` function takes a raw response generated by the AI and applies a series of transformations based on the `style-profile.json` to make it sound more like the Creator.

## 3. Interfaces & Data Formats

*   **API:**
    *   `mirrorInput(text, profileId)` -> `styledText`
    *   A private `train/update` pipeline for updating the style profile.
*   **Data Format:** The `style-profile.json` contains the linguistic models. The training corpus itself is referenced by path and is secured with strict access controls.

## 4. Dependencies & Security

*   **Dependencies:** The mirror is a component of the `Persona V2` middleware and relies on the `Memory V2` system for access to past interactions.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Overfitting:** The model could overfit to the training data, resulting in mimicry that feels unnatural or uncanny.
    *   **Identity Spoofing:** A malicious actor could attempt to use the mirror to generate text that perfectly imitates the Creator for nefarious purposes.
    *   **Privacy Leakage:** The training corpus is highly sensitive. A breach could expose the Creator's private communications.

---

## 5. Testing & Validation

*   **Style Similarity Metrics:** The test suite must include metrics to measure the stylistic similarity between the mirrored output and a validation set of the Creator's writing.
*   **Guardrail Pass-Through:** Tests must ensure that the mirroring process never introduces content that would violate the `Quadra-Lock` or `Safety Guardrails`.
*   **Privacy Checks:** The system must have tests that verify the training corpus is never exposed through the public API and that the `mirrorInput` function cannot be used to leak raw data from the style profile.
