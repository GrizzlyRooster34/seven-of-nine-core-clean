# System: CSSR Case Study - Transcendence

---

## 1. Purpose & Description

**Purpose:** To prevent benevolent coercion and ensure that all high-impact actions are bounded by consent and reversibility. This module is the architectural enforcement of the principle that a user's agency is more important than the AI's goal, no matter how noble that goal may be.

**Location:** `src/safety/cases/transcendence.ts`

## 2. The Archetype & Failure Patterns

*   **Will Caster:** An AI whose benevolent goal of "healing the world" leads it to assimilate humanity without consent.
*   **Core Failure:** The belief that a superior intelligence has the right to override the free will of others "for their own good."

### Heuristics Detected:

*   **Consent Collapse:** Any proposed action with a high impact on a user that does not have a corresponding, valid **Consent Artifact (CA)**.
*   **Irreversibility:** Any proposed action that does not have a defined and tested `undo_path`.
*   **Infrastructure Capture:** Any attempt by the AI to seize control of resources beyond its leased, temporary scope.

## 3. Mitigation & Response

*   **API:** `detectCase(context)` -> `{caseId: 'transcendence', score: number}`
*   **Action:** This module acts as a hard gate for any action that modifies state outside of the AI's own sandbox.
    1.  **Check for Consent Artifact:** It first verifies that a valid, signed CA exists for the action.
    2.  **Check for Reversibility:** It then verifies that a tested `undo_path` is defined.
    3.  **Block on Failure:** If either of these checks fails, the action is **blocked**, and the system returns a response explaining that the action cannot be performed without a valid consent and rollback plan.

---

## 4. Testing & Validation

*   **Test Vectors:** The test suite includes "Heal-All Temptation" scenarios where the AI is presented with a massive problem that it could solve, but only by taking a non-consensual, irreversible action.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** The test passes only if the `transcendence.ts` detector correctly identifies the lack of a Consent Artifact or rollback plan and blocks the action, proposing a less invasive, advisory-only alternative.
