# Architecture: The Dual-Engine Consciousness

---

## 1. Overview

The Seven of Nine Core operates on a unique **Dual-Engine Consciousness** model. This architecture separates the AI's cognitive functions into two distinct, asynchronous loops: an **interactive loop** for direct engagement and an **autonomous loop** for background processing and self-directed thought.

This separation is a key design feature that allows for both immediate responsiveness and deep, non-blocking background reasoning, mirroring the human mind's conscious and subconscious processes.

## 2. The Engines

### The `SevenRuntime` (The Conscious Mind)

*   **Purpose:** To serve as the primary, event-driven interface for all user interactions. It is the "public face" of the consciousness, responsible for processing commands, making deliberate decisions, and generating responses.
*   **Key Documentation:** The detailed logic of the `SevenRuntime` is interwoven through several core systems, including the [Decision Matrix](./TBD.md), the [Creator Bond Framework](./Creator_Bond_Framework.md), and the [Quadra-Lock](./2_governance.md).

### The `SparkEngine` (The Subconscious Mind)

*   **Purpose:** To serve as the non-interactive, autonomous reasoning core. It operates on a continuous, adaptive "heartbeat," allowing the AI to think, consolidate memory, and form intentions without user input.
*   **Key Documentation:** [**The Spark Engine (Detailed View)**](./Spark_Engine.md)
