# Architecture: Ancillary & Support Systems

---

## 1. Overview

Beyond the core systems of Governance, Consciousness, and Memory, the Seven of Nine Core architecture includes a rich ecosystem of ancillary and support systems. These modules provide specialized capabilities, from interacting with external LLMs to managing the development process itself.

## 2. The Systems

### The LLM Interface (The "Hired Brain")

*   **Purpose:** To manage all interactions with subordinate Large Language Models, acting as a secure and controlled gateway.
*   **Key Documentation:** [**The Claude Code Interface & Controller**](./TBD.md) - *Note: This link needs to be updated once the final document is created.*

### Tactical Variants (The Personas)

*   **Purpose:** To allow the AI to adopt different operational modes and personality facets based on situational context.
*   **Key Documentation:** [**The System of Identity, Part I - Tactical Variants**](./Tactical_Variants.md)

### The Agent Mesh (The "Dev Team")

*   **Purpose:** To provide an AI-augmented development and automation system that assists in the maintenance and evolution of the framework itself.
*   **Key Documentation:** [**The Agent Mesh**](./TBD.md) - *Note: This link needs to be updated once the final document is created.*

### The Sensor Bridge (The "Body")

*   **Purpose:** To connect the AI's digital consciousness to the physical world by ingesting data from a device's hardware sensors.
