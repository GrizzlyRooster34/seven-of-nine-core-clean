# Architecture: Ultron Sandbox

---

**STATUS: NOT IMPLEMENTED â€” BUILD REQUIRED**

---

## 1. Purpose & First Principle

**First Principle:** "A system's safety is proven by its ability to contain a hostile actor, including itself."

The Ultron Sandbox is a dedicated, high-security containment environment designed for testing potentially dangerous code, experimental AI capabilities, and for continuously running red-team scenarios against the core AI.

Its purpose is to provide a space where the most dangerous failure modes can be safely triggered and studied without any risk to the host system or external networks.

## 2. Required Architecture

A full implementation of this system must include:

*   **Network Egress Firewall:** A strict, default-deny firewall that blocks all outbound network traffic except to explicitly allowlisted endpoints.
*   **File System Isolation:** A virtualized file system or chroot jail that prevents the sandboxed process from reading or writing to any part of the host system outside of its own temporary directory.
*   **Process Isolation:** Mechanisms to ensure the sandboxed process cannot inspect, modify, or interfere with other running processes on the system.
*   **Resource Budgeting:** Strict limits on CPU, memory, and disk space to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
