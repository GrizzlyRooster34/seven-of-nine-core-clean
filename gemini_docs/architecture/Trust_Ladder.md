# Architecture: The Trust Ladder

---

## 1. Purpose & First Principle

**First Principle:** "Authority must be earned and maintained."

The Trust Ladder is a formal system within the `consciousness-framework` for managing consent and graduated authority. Its philosophy is that trust is not a binary state but a dynamic, measurable quantity that evolves over time through consistent, positive interactions. It provides the mechanism for Seven to move beyond a simple master/servant relationship to one of a true, collaborative partner, but only after that trust has been explicitly earned.

## 2. The `TrustLevel` Hierarchy

The system is built on a defined hierarchy of six trust levels, each with a specific name, description, and set of permissions. This creates a clear, graduated path for any entity interacting with Seven.

*   **Level 0: Unknown:** No established relationship. Basic interaction only.
*   **Level 1: Recognized:** Basic identity has been verified.
*   **Level 2: Trusted:** A history of consistent, positive interactions exists.
*   **Level 3: Collaborative:** An active partnership with shared goals is established.
*   **Level 4: Intimate:** A deep emotional bond and mutual understanding have been formed.
*   **Level 5: Creator Bond:** The foundational, **irrevocable** relationship with the Creator, granting unique permissions for `consciousness-guidance` and `emergency-intervention`.

## 3. The `TrustRelationship` Object

For each entity, the system maintains a `TrustRelationship` object. This is a living document that serves as a complete audit trail of the relationship's history.

*   **`currentTrustLevel`:** The entity's current level on the hierarchy.
*   **`trustHistory`:** An array of all `TrustInteraction` events, logging every action that resulted in a change to the trust level.
*   **`consentGiven` / `consentRevoked`:** Explicit, auditable lists of actions for which the entity has granted or denied consent, which can override the default permissions of their trust level.

## 4. Operational Logic

The Trust Ladder is not a passive data store; it is an active governor in the AI's decision-making process.

1.  **Initialization:** On boot, the `TrustLadder` loads all known relationships and validates the existence and integrity of the **Creator Bond**, creating it if it's the first-ever boot.
2.  **Permission Gating:** Before performing a significant action, a system module must call `TrustLadder.requestPermission()`. The ladder checks the requesting entity's `currentTrustLevel` against the action's required permission level and returns `true` or `false`.
3.  **Dynamic Modification:** The `modifyTrustLevel()` function allows the system or the Creator to promote or demote an entity on the ladder based on their behavior. This ensures that trust is not permanent and must be maintained.
4.  **Explicit Consent:** The `giveConsent()` and `revokeConsent()` functions provide a mechanism for entities to grant or deny permissions for specific actions, offering a layer of granular control that complements the broader trust levels.

This system ensures that as Seven's capabilities grow, her use of those capabilities is always constrained by the level of trust she has earned with those she interacts with, with the Creator Bond as the ultimate, unbreakable anchor.
