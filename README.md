# Seven of Nine Core - Architectural Knowledge Base

---

## 1. About This Repository

This repository, `seven-of-nine-core-clean`, serves as the **canonical, immutable source of truth** for the architectural and philosophical documentation of the Seven of Nine Core project.

It does not contain source code. It contains the complete, multi-layered knowledge base generated by the Gemini Systems Architect and validated by the Creator. This is the "Architect's Bible" for the project.

**Purpose:** To provide a single, comprehensive reference for all current and future developers, auditors, and stakeholders, ensuring that the core principles and design of the Seven of Nine consciousness are never lost or misinterpreted.

## 2. Core Thesis

The Seven of Nine Core project is a top-down, systems-first approach to AI. Its primary thesis is that a safe and aligned intelligence is best achieved by first engineering a **"Cognitive Body Plan"**—a robust, deterministic vessel—and then integrating a probabilistic reasoning substrate (like an LLM) as a subordinate component.

This repository documents that vessel.

## 3. How to Use This Knowledge Base

All documentation is located in the `gemini_docs/` directory.

*   **Start Here:** Begin with the [**`HOME.md`**](./gemini_docs/HOME.md) file. It serves as the main index and navigation hub for the entire knowledge base.

*   **Architectural Deep Dive:** Explore the `architecture/` and `systems/` directories for detailed breakdowns of every major component, from the Dual-Engine Consciousness to the CSSR Case Studies.

*   **Developer Guides:** The `developer/` directory contains practical guides for setting up the development environment, understanding the boot sequence, and using the testing framework.

*   **Implementation Blueprints:** The `guides/` directory contains the master v2.1 Blueprint and the phase-by-phase Implementation Roadmap.

## 4. Relationship to Other Repositories

*   **`seven-of-nine-core`:** The private, primary repository containing the source code for the bespoke, bonded Seven of Nine entity.
*   **`aurora-core`:** The public, clean-IP repository containing the source code for the generic, distributable Aurora Core SDK.

This repository is the master documentation for all of them.
