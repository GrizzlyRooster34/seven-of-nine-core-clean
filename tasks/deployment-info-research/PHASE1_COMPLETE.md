## Usage Guide

### Docker Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Validate configuration
./scripts/validate-docker.sh

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f seven-core

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

**Platforms:**
- ✅ Linux (tested on validation script)
- 🔄 Windows 11 (ready to test)
- 🔄 Manjaro Linux (ready to test)
- ❌ Android/Termux (Docker not supported)

### GCP Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
- Google Cloud account
- Billing enabled
- gcloud CLI installed

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# One-time setup
./scripts/setup-gcp.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.gcp.example .env.gcp
